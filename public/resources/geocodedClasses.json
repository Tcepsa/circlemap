A soft knit cap is recommended to protect the head from bumps. Cave visitors also bring their own flashlight.\n\nYou are invited to meet at the nature center at noon for a BYO picnic lunch in their outdoor pavillion.

Please be aware of the potentially significant drive time to the cave location depending on where you are coming from. \n\nThe nature center closes at 4pm and so we will need to leave by then, although the program itself will end before 4. \n\nThis program is geared toward students ages 7-15 approximately. Slightly younger children may attend but only if they can descend a ladder into the caves independently and remain in the cave system for the full course of the program. Slightly older students may attend if interested. No one aged 5 or younger is permitted in the cave. \n\nAt least one parent/chaperone per family is expected to attend and go into the cave with the group. \n\nPlease wear long sleeves, pants, closed toe shoes, and a soft knit cap to protect your head.

Dogs don't have a spoken language like we do, however they do have rich emotional lives, and they often \"wear their emotions on their sleeve\". Almost every single body part on a dog has a story to tell! All we have to do is pay close attention and look for clues to tell us how they're feeling. Please join us for a presentation and workshop on reading canine body language to reduce the chances of your kids or you being bit, and to set yourself and your family up for safer, more enjoyable interactions with willing dogs!!

With Lots of Love is a story about a girl who has moved to the United States from her home in Central America, away from everything she leaves behind and longs for- especially her Abuela. Rocio does her best to adjust to a new way of living, but there are many things she misses from her old life – Abuela’s cooking, Abuela’s piñata creations, Abuela’s warm hugs, and of course, Abuela herself most of all. But Abuela finds a way to send Rocio something special just in time for her birthday – a gift wrapped with lots of love – and that fills Rocio to the brim. The themes of familial relatitudeionships, food, celebrations, and connecting with loved ones over long distances in With Lots of Love will be sure to inspire and comfort young children and families all year long!\n\nThis book selection is this year's Jumpstart's Read for the Record! Jumpstart’s Read for the Record is the world’s largest shared reading experience and celebrates and supports children’s early language and social-emotional development. Over 26 million people have participated - and this is CIRCLE's chance to be a part of it! Because this is a Jumpstart Read for the Record book, I do have the option to order special edition copies at a discount - please indicate if and how many you would like. If we order enough copies, they will be even cheaper. \n\nAfter we read our story, we will discuss the book as well as parts of the story and our favorite foods and important people. We will also learn how to write letters (or draw pictures for younger kids) and how to address and stamp an envelope. I will provide the stamps and envelopes and even mail them when we leave class! Parents, I suggest you bring addresses so your child can practice writing the address (or you can show them how you would put it on an envelope, for pre-writers). We may do a few other fun activities relatitudeed to the book as well. \n\nThis class overlaps with Terra Kids, but is open to anyone.
